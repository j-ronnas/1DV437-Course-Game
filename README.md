To the Stars is a 2D shooter-game in a space setting. The game consists mainly of a scene in which the player controls a space craft and ﬁres weapons at enemy ships. Additionally the game features space stations in which the player can upgrade and repair the ship. The player travels between diﬀerent stars which work as levels the player has to clear before being able to move on. The game is over when the player clears the last level or when the player dies. The player is then presented with a screen showing various statistics as well as a total score for the game-session.
